You've created an account and have 100 followers, mostly from irl friends who care about you. But you want to belong to the fray! How are you getting more?

A) Post your vacation last week
B) Buy 1k follower growth (-$100)
C) Wait a day

B. Your investment pays off (+840 followers) but at a cost of a few jealous irl friends (-10 followers).

A) Reconnect with irl friends
B) Buy another 1k follower growth
C) Ask a local business for sponsorship deal

B) Spill (fake) tea
C) Buy 10k follower growth (-$800)

C) Push a new, unproven product

❌

A. Unfortunately, buying and lying your way to the top didn't work this time. You have now ostracized many people on and offline despite your crocodile tears and positive videos (-4000 followers) and are bankrupt. You now wish to live peacefully and touch grass.

A) Run command --git-purged on your profiles

❌
